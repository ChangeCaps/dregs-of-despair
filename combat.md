# Combat

## Turns
At the start of combat, every combatant roll a d20 and adds their initiative, turns are taking according to that number in descending order. Highest initiative first, then the second highest, and so on.

## Actions
In combat every action is paid for in action points (AP). A character by default has 4 action points each turn.

## Movement
Each turn a character can move 4 hexes, these can be moved, at any time during the turn, in any amount. Action points can be spent to move that amount of additional hexes. When moving from a hex within another characters retaliation hex, that character may use a retaliation against the moving character.

## Melee
When doing a melee attack, if the target has a dodge greater than zero, the attacker rolls a d12 and adds the value to the attacks hit bonus. If the sum is less that the targets dodge, the attack misses. If the attack succeeds the target is dealt the damage of the attack.
After the attack resolves, the target may use a retaliation against the attacker.

### Retaliation
Retaliations are special actions that can be performed as a reaction to certain enemy actions. A character by default has one per turn. Retaliations can only be performed using equipped items. Retaliations are primarily triggered by movement and attacks.
